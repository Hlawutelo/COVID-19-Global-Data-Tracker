# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
## Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from Our World in Data to visualize and understand global pandemic trends. The analysis focuses on key metrics including case numbers, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries, providing insights into how the pandemic evolved over time and varied by region.

## Objectives

- Download and clean COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
- Analyze global and country-specific COVID-19 trends
- Visualize key metrics such as case numbers, death rates, and vaccination rates
- Compare pandemic progression across different countries
- Identify correlations between various pandemic indicators
- Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively


## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python : Primary programming language
- Pandas : Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy : Numerical computing
- Matplotlib : Data visualization
- Seaborn : Enhanced data visualization
- Plotly Express : Interactive visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook : Interactive development environment


## How to Run/View the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended)
2. Install the required libraries bash : pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter (Run)

3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
4. Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook: bash jupyter notebook
5. Open the covid-data.ipynb notebook in the Jupyter interface
6. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations


## Insights and Reflections

- The dataset from Our World in Data provides comprehensive COVID-19 information across 255 locations worldwide
- Data cleaning was necessary to handle missing values, particularly for daily case and vaccination metrics
- The analysis reveals significant variations in how different countries experienced and responded to the pandemic
- Vaccination rates show interesting patterns when compared with case fatality rates
- The project demonstrates the power of data visualization in understanding complex global health phenomena
- Future work could explore additional correlations between pandemic metrics and socioeconomic factors


## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from Our World in Data : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-19 , which compiles COVID-19 statistics from official sources worldwide.
